## Course Text {.unnumbered}

As the semester progresses, we are going to read a book together. The book we're reading is

The book is available electronically or in hardcover from Amazon and other retailers. The schedule for reading the book is part of the Course Calendar.

Additional sources will be presented and/or referenced in class and gathered at our website.

## Emergency? {.unnumbered}

What if my situation changes (for any reason) during the semester?

If you need to miss a session, just review the materials (including the class recording, if available) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help.

If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of an assignment, send an email to Dr. Love saying the following:

> I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (*list things you're worried about completing*) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans.

- Dr. Love will respond with "OK" and temporarily excuse you from things until **you** send a "re-connection" email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time he'll evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.
